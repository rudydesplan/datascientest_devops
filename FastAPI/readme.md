# Background

For this evaluation, we will put ourselves in the shoes of a company that creates questionnaires via a smartphone or web browser application.

To simplify the architecture of these different products, the company wants to set up an API.

The purpose of this API is to query a database to return a series of questions.

The objective is to create this API.

## The data
Our database is represented by a csv file available at this [adress](https://github.com/rudydesplan/datascientest_devops/blob/main/FastAPI/questions.csv)
